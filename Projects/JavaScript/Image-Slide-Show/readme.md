### Created an image slideshow 
***
#### Objective
The goal of this exercise was to create a slideshow of images using JavaScript. 

#### My solution
As a fan of all things astronomy. I thought it would be cool to grab images of nine planets along with the sun and create a slide show of our solar system.

#### The Result
I was able to get the slide to work with all the planets cycling through at a set interval
