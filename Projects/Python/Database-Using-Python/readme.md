### Developing a Database using Python
*** 

### Objective

In this course I was introduced to SQLite and integrating it with Python.

The final drill was do the four following tasks:
* Create a database table in RAM named Roster that includes the fields 'Name', 'Species' and 'IQ'
* Populate your new table with the following values
  1. Jean-Baptiste Zorg, Human, 122
  2. Korben Dallas, Meat Popsicle, 100
  3. Ak'not, Mangalore, \-5
* Update the Species of Korben Dallas to be Human
* Display the names and IQs of everyone in the table who is classified as Human

### Steps Taken

For the SQLite script within the quotes, I used a lot of my prior experience with SQL to build out my commands. The Python portion took more research and work to ensure I had the write syntax to get it functioning. Thank goodness for error messages that help narrow the search for where my code needed fixing.

### Results

Having had experience with SQL already it was easy to work with SQLite and develop the database commands needed to complete the drills within the quotes. It was the Python that required more trial and error to complete the drill. I was able to get all four drills in the assignement to work. I did enjoy the fact the database was for characters from the movie Fifth Element, though not sure how Ak'not could have an IQ of -5 on an IQ scale that starts at 0.
